Title: Lean consumption

Lean consumption is based on lean manufacturing, also known as lean production. Lean Manufacturing was pioneered by Toyota founder Taiichi Ohno, and revolutionized and streamlined the manufacturing industry. Whereas lean manufacturing set out ways to streamline manufacturing processes, lean consumption "minimizes customers' time and effort by delivering exactly what they want when and where they want it". Processes are focused on eliminating waste, while increasing productivity, speed of operation and improving customer interaction.

History
In the fall of 2005, James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones published an article in the Harvard Business Review describing a new theory called Lean Consumption. This process was proposed for large corporations, but smaller corporations have been able to take this theory and apply it to small business. This has the effect of more efficient business and better customer service and SLAs.

Lean consumption in the IT Industry
The industry most affected by Lean Consumption is the IT and Computer Services Industry. Companies like Microsoft and IBM are the most notable companies to employ Lean Consumption or some variation of the theory. A notable smaller adoptee is Cybernomics, which has been able to employ Lean Consumption theory to better satisfy customers by giving them exactly what they require when they require it and at the same time, planning ahead with Proactive IT to avoid break-fix situations, all while lowering cost to the end user.
