Title: Cow (public service announcement)

Cow, also titled Only Stwpd Cowz Txt N Drive, is a 30-minute public information film directed by Peter Watkins-Hughes with assistance from Gwent Police and Tredegar Comprehensive School in Wales. The August 2009 film was a co-production by Gwent Police and Tred Films, with special effects by Zipline Creative Limited. The film features original music by Stuart Fox, a composer and sound designer from Gloucester, England. A previous film, Lucky Luke, was intended to warn about the dangers of joyriding; Cow was intended to be a sequel of sorts. The film was shown to students in the UK and was released on YouTube.
The film, using local drama students as actors, tells the story of 17-year-old Cassie "Cow" Cowan (Jenny Davies), who texts and drives and gets into a car accident; her friends Emm and Jules (Amy Ingram and Laura Quantick) are in the vehicle with her. Four people, including Emm and Jules, die as a result of Cow's actions. The police intended for the film to be aired in British schools.
The film cost "a few thousand pounds" to make. Three hundred drama students auditioned for the film.
The full film is shown to students in the United Kingdom. As of 2009 the film had not been aired on television stations in the United States. In 2010, a modified 30-second version of the public service announcement was to begin airing during certain hours on 13 television stations in central and upstate South Carolina.

Story
Cassie "Cow" Cowan, Emma "Emm" Williams, and Jules O'Shea, three teenage friends who work at the same hardware shop in Tredegar, Gwent, agree to leave work early in order to cheer up Jules, who threw up on duty after discovering that she was pregnant. On the way home, Cow texts while driving and her car drifts across the road and collides head-on with another car. Subsequently, a third driver accidentally crashes into them. Emm and Jules are killed in the accident, along with a couple in the second vehicle involved in the crash, while the couple's young son survives. It is not clear what the outcome is for the third driver or a young baby of the second driver.
The rest of the film depicts the accident's aftermath and consequences. The police break the news to bereaved relatives, and Cow herself almost dies in hospital, but is revived. At the hospital, Cow's father meets the grandmother of the couple's son. In the aftermath of the accident, Cow and her parents are ostracised by the local community, starting with when Cow's parents attend Emm's funeral but are demanded to leave the wake on account of Cow being the cause of Emm's death. Cow gets berated by another patient over her actions, while Jules' boyfriend Morgan appears on television to express his grief about the death of their unborn baby (although he had previously dumped her because of the pregnancy). Cow's mother visits the supermarket, but because one of the assistants there was the sister of one of the victims in the second car, the cashier refuses to serve her. When a local paper reports that Cow was breathalyzed shortly before the accident, her father gets shunned by his colleagues at work (she was stopped by the police for speeding, but passed the test). The last straw is when an unknown assailant spray paints "Murdering Cow" on Cow's parents' garage door. Eventually, despite her mother's reassurances that she did nothing wrong, Cow is sentenced to seven years imprisonment for causing death by dangerous driving. A postscript notes that the victims' families tried to sue Cow and her family, but were unsuccessful.

It will help." Mick Giannasi, the then chief constable of Gwent Police, said "The messages contained in the film are as relevant to the people of Tennessee as they are to the residents of Tredegar." He also said "Texting and driving can have tragic consequences, and the more this film is viewed, the better."
