Title: Dana 80

The Dana/Spicer Model 80 is an automotive axle manufactured by Dana Holding Corporation and has been used in OEM heavy duty applications by Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford. It can be identified by its straight axle tubes, 10 bolt asymmetrical cover, and an "80" cast into the housing. Dana 80's are made as full floating, rear axles only and are a step up in overall strength compared to the Dana 70.   1988 Ford was the first company to use the Dana 80. The Dana 80 has a GAWR up to 11,000 pounds (5,000 kg), however it is common practice among manufacturers to derate Dana 80's. Gross axle weight ratings are lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons. The OEM Limited slip differential originally was a "Power Lok" until 1998 when the "Trac Lok" phased it out. Trac Loks were a US$350.00 option with Ford Super Duty trucks.  The Dana 80 Trac Lok is unique being it is a 4 pinion unit, unlike other Dana Trac Lok units with 2 pinions. This was the only rear axle available for the 2nd generation Dodge Ram 3500 trucks.
