Title: Cosworth KF engine

The Cosworth-Opel KF engine is a production-based, four-stroke, 2.5-liter, naturally aspirated, V-6 high-revving racing engine, originally designed, developed and produced by Opel, in collaboration with Cosworth, for the DTM and later ITC, between 1993 and 1996. The engines were tuned by Cosworth, and were based on the Isuzu 6VD1 (1996) 75° production engine, as used in the Opel Monterey, Opel Frontera Limited, Trooper, Rodeo, and Amigo.
It is also used in the Gould GR51 open-wheel race car of the Hillclimb and Sprint Association (HSA) British Sprint Championship, since 2000.
