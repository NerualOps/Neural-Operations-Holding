Title: City Transformer

City Transformer is an Israeli electric vehicle company founded in 2014 by Asaf Formoza and Udi Meridor. 
City Transformer has 2 models: CT-1 – ready for production, and CT-2 – future model.

History
In 2013 Formoza, Gidi Goldwine, and Erez Abramov developed a foldable car chassis design. This mechanism enabled them to create a two-seater urban electric micro vehicle that could change its width while driving, transforming from a width of 1.4 meters to a width of 1 meter. The wide mode is designated for open roads where the vehicle can reach a speed of 90 km/h and the narrow mode is designated for urban heavy traffic and for parking in narrow spaces. The founders then created a two-seater electric vehicle that changed its width while driving.
In 2014, the company was founded and automobile designer Eyal Kremer joined the company along with Johanne Tomforde.  In late 2017, the car concept was revealed at the Smart mobility Summit in Tel Aviv. The design has received various awards, including a gold medal in passenger vehicle design at the German Design Council in 2023.
The company received a grant of NIS 3.15 million ($900,000) from the Innovations authority of Israel, in conjunction with the Israel Prime Minister's Office's national program for fuel alternatives and smart mobility. The company's concept was revealed in 2017.
In 2020, the company was featured in Time’s "100 inventions for 2020".
In 2021, the company signed a deal to provide United Hatzalah emergency responders with vehicles that have the ability to contract to 1 meter for easy maneuvering in times of emergency. In 2022, the company entered a partnership with Bosch Software.
The company raised $20 million since inception, from private and corporate investors, including: Afifi Group, Lubinski Group, Matam Motors, Eitan Ben-Eliyahu, Barak Rosen and Eyal Chomsky.
