Title: Battery electric bus

A battery electric bus is an electric bus that is driven by an electric motor and obtains energy from on-board batteries. Many trolleybuses use batteries as an auxiliary or emergency power source.
Battery electric buses offer the potential for zero-emissions, in addition to much quieter operation and better acceleration compared to traditional buses. They also eliminate infrastructure needed for a constant grid connection and allow routes to be modified without infrastructure changes, in contrast with a trolleybus. They typically recover braking energy to increase efficiency by a regenerative brake. With energy consumption of about 1.2 kW⋅h/km (4.3 MJ/km; 1.9 kW⋅h/mi), the cost of ownership is lower than diesel buses.
In 2018, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that total operating costs per mile of an electric bus fleet in the United States in some cases may be less expensive than a diesel bus fleet.

History
The London Electrobus Company started running the first ever service of battery electric buses between London's Victoria station and Liverpool Street on 15 July 1907. However, the weight and inefficiency of batteries meant that other propulsion technology - such as electric trolleybuses or diesel buses - became commonplace.
The first battery buses were mostly small, mini- or midi- buses. 
The improvement of battery technology from around 2010 led to the emergence of the mass-produced battery bus, including heavier units such as 12.2-meter (40 ft) standard buses and articulated buses. 
China was the first country to introduce modern battery electric buses in large scale. In 2009 Shanghai catenary bus lines began switching to battery buses.
In September 2010, Chinese automobile company BYD began manufacturing the BYD K9, one of the most popular electric buses
The first city to heavily invest in electric buses was Shenzhen, China. The city began rolling out electric buses made by BYD in 2011, with the objective of having a fully electric fleet. By 2017, Shenzhen's entire fleet of over 16,300 buses was replaced with electric buses, the largest fleet of electric buses of any city in the world.

According to Bloomberg, "China had about 99 percent of the 385,000 electric buses on the roads worldwide in 2017, accounting for 17 percent of the country's entire fleet." Chinese cities are adding 1,900 electric buses per week.
As of 2016 battery buses have less range, higher weight, higher procurement costs. The reduced infrastructure for overhead lines is offset by the costs of the infrastructure to recharge the batteries. In addition, the additional weight of batteries in a battery electric bus means that they have a lower passenger capacity than trolleybuses in jurisdictions where there is a legal limit on axle loads on roads. Battery buses are used almost exclusively in urban areas rather than for long-haul transportation. Urban transit features relatively short intervals between charging opportunities. Sufficient recharging can take place within 4 to 5 minutes (250 to 450 kW [340 to 600 hp]) usually by induction or catenary.

Charging
Different types of e-bus depot charging infrastructure
Overnight charging for operations that rely on overnight charging, DC-distributed architectures with up to 50 kW charging points allow buses to be fully charged in 8 to 10 hours.

Opportunity charging
Commonly, metropolitan electric busses are charged on-route with 6-8 minutes of charging at 450 kW for every hour of operation. Opportunity charging is available at bus stops with overhead chargers utilizing the SAE J3105 standard and at terminals at the end of the bus route. Slower, 50kW to 175kW overnight charging at plug-in chargers is utilized too. Sometimes wireless charging pads are utilized, but plug-in stations are more common due to the fact that are faster and more efficient.
The bus's daily schedule takes into account the need to charge, keeping the overall schedule as close to optimal as possible. Today, there are various software companies that help bus operators manage their electric bus charging schedule. These solutions ensure that buses continue to operate safely, without any unplanned stops and inconvenience to passengers.
Supercapacitors can be charged rapidly, reducing the time needed to prepare to resume operation.
The Society of Automotive Engineers has published Recommended Practice SAE J3105 to standardize physical automated connection interfaces for conductive charging systems since 2020. For communication between charger and electric bus the same ISO 15118 protocol is used as for passenger car charging. The only differences are in the charging power, voltage and physical interface.
Pantographs and underbody collectors can be integrated in bus stops to quicken electric bus recharge, making it possible to use a smaller battery on the bus, which reduces the initial investment and subsequent costs.

Inductive or Conductive charging
Inductive charging for buses is a form of wireless charging that uses electromagnetic fields to transfer energy from ground-based pads or coils to receivers on the underside of a bus.
Conductive charging power is supplied through a conductive device (rails or pads) embedded in the road or track surface at the bus or tram stop. When tram or electric bus stops, a current collector shoe automatically lowers and makes contact to charge the on-board battery. In tramway operation, this process takes no longer than 20 seconds – ordinary dwell time - leading to seamless operations.

In-Motion Charging
In-Motion Charging (IMC) trolleybus system is a sustainable urban transport technology, primarily for trolleybuses, that allows electric vehicles to charge their batteries while moving using electrified infrastructure, such as overhead lines.

Total operating cost per mile
NREL publishes zero-emission bus evaluation results from various commercial operators. NREL published following total operating cost per mile: with County Connection, for June 2017 through May 2018, for an 8-vehicle diesel bus fleet, the total operating cost per mile was $0.84; for a 4-vehicle electric bus fleet, $1.11; with Long Beach Transit, for 2018, for a 10-vehicle electric bus fleet, $0.85; and with Foothill Transit, for 2018, for a 12-vehicle electric bus fleet, $0.84.
