Title: Moustache Bikes

Moustache Bikes is a French brand of EPAC (electronically power assisted cycle), named Cycle Me, a company based in the Vosges since 2011.

Concept
Vosges-based Cycle Me designs and assembles top-of-the-range electrically assisted bicycles under the Moustache Bikes brand. The name refers to the moustache-shaped handlebars of the early 20th century. Moustache Bikes stand out for the design of their frames, their solidity and reliability, and the care taken with the finish. As a result, the selling price is high.
From the outset, a vast range of models was offered for different uses: city bikes, but also mountain bikes, off-road bikes, tandems and later cargo bikes.
The sturdy metal frames are mainly imported from Taiwan, although a wooden frame was also tested. All models feature batteries and an electric motor from German equipment manufacturer Bosch.
These bikes, initially distributed exclusively by a hundred or so independent specialist shops in France and a hundred or so in Europe (England, Germany and the Benelux countries) are, 2019, shipped to 500 dealers all over the world. 45% of production is exported.

Story
Cycle Me was created in 2011 by Emmanuel Antonot and Grégory Sand, in Golbey, near Épinal. Emmanuel Antonot previously worked for Lapierre bikes, one of Europe's oldest bicycle manufacturers.
The initial formula quickly met with success. Sales rose from 1,500 units in 2012 to 3000 in 2013. In 2015, the FCPR Initiative et Finance announced that it had acquired a stake in the company's capital. Even so, the Cycle Me intends to retain its independence.
In 2017, the assembly plant moved to Thaon-les-Vosges: the new assembly line is designed to produce 100,000 Unit bikes per year. The assembly workshop can assemble 200 Unit bikes per day. The catalogue offers 70 Unit models and the research and development team is capable of designing a new prototype in 10 Unit days. The company employs around one hundred people and has a turnover of around 70,000,000 in 2019.
In 2021, the founders installed a third assembly line at Thaon-les-Vosges and brought wheel assembly in-house.
