Title: Nash Airflyte

Nash Motors used the Airflyte name for several cars from 1949 until 1955. The automaker also distributed the Nash Airflyte Magazine during that time.

Models under the Airflyte brand
1949-1951: Full-size cars characterized by an aerodynamic, rounded shape.
The models within this series included:

Nash 600(renamed Statesman in 1950)
Nash Ambassador
1950-1955: Compact-sized Nash Rambler
1952-1954: The full-size cars were restyled and initially dubbed "Golden Airflytes" to celebrate Nash Motors' 50th anniversary in 1952. These models adopted a more squared-off look than the earlier Airflytes, including larger wheel cutouts in the front fenders.

Airflyte magazine
The Nash Airflyte Magazine was a publication of the Nash Motor Company in the 1950s. Distributed to owners of Nash cars, it featured content about lifestyles, experiences, and travels, in addition to the vehicles they drove.
