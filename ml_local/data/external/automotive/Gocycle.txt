Title: Gocycle

Gocycle is an electric bicycle manufactured by Karbon Kinetics Limited, a company founded in 2002 by Richard Thorpe. Thorpe is an industrial designer who formerly worked at the racing car company McLaren. The Gocycle features quick-release wheels that are designed to be easily interchanged, along with a fully enclosed chain, gearing and cabling system. Frame and wheels are molded magnesium and a flat pack storage and transport system allows the bicycle to be disassembled and carried in a case. The electric motor is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.
