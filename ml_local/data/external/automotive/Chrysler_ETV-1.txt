Title: Chrysler ETV-1

The Chrysler ETV-1 was a passenger car glider produced by Chrysler as a test bed for motor and drive controls. With a motor produced by General Electric, it was claimed to be the "first ground up modern day electric vehicle design."
Two vehicles were produced: ETV-1 and ETV-1-2. While the original is in private hands, the second is in the Boyertown Museum of Historic Vehicles in Boyertown, Pennsylvania.

Specifications
Powertrain
The ETV-1  uses one 30.5 kW (40.9 hp) separately excited electric motor, front-mounted driving the front axle. Chrysler's ETV-1 has claimed acceleration of 0 to 48 km/h (0 to 30 mph) in 9.0 seconds and a claimed top speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).

Battery
ETV-1 utilises a removable T-shaped battery pack of 18 6V Globe-Union EV2-13 batteries. The electric vehicle battery pack has a total capacity of approximately 12.7 kWh based on load-leveled test of the production Globe EV-1000 version of the EV2-13 hand-built batteries used in the ETV-1 pack.
