Title: Dana S 110

The Dana/Spicer Model S110 is an automotive axle manufactured by the Dana Holding Corporation and the Eaton Corporation.  Eaton manufactures the differential and Dana manufactures the rest of the axle.   The S110 model follows a newer nomenclature for Dana axles.   The "S" meaning: single rear axle.  The first "1" representing gear reduction type, the second representing the head assembly series and the last "0" representing the design level.
The Dana S110 is used in Class 4 and Class 5 applications.  Dodge, Ford and General Motors use this axle as well as various other companies.  The Dana S110 is a full floating, drop-out axle.  Dana S110 axles are a step up in overall strength compared to the Dana 80.  Ford started using this axle in 2005 model F-450 and F-550 trucks.  Replacing the Dana 80 in some class 4 trucks, and the Dana S 135 in the rest of the trucks.  Dodge started using the Dana S110 in their 2008 model 4500 and 5500 trucks.   Although this axle is designed for medium-duty, commercial-trucks, Ford did put the S110 in 2008-2010 & 2015-2016 F-450 Pick up trucks.  The Dana S110 has a GAWR up to 14,706 lbs
