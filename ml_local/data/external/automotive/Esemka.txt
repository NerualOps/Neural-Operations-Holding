Title: Esemka

PT Solo Manufaktur Kreasi, trading as Esemka, is an Indonesian automotive company based in Solo, Indonesia. The "Esemka" brand was named as the abbreviation of vocational high school (Indonesian: SMK/Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan) to recognize the effort of the students to develop the native car brand. Though initially local media used to term it as national car brand of Indonesia, but the company described Esemka as a vehicle which is totally made in Indonesia. Since 2013 an average of 10 units of SUV and mini trucks had been manufactured per month by the company. The company started commercial production of various model of cars and minivan in its manufacturing plant at Demangan village, Boyolali Regency in Central Java since 2016.  It was officially inaugurated by interim president of indonesia Joko Widodo on 6 September 2019. At the time of inauguration, the manufacturing plant has production capacity of 12,000 vehicles per year. Esemka uses locally made components from companies such as PT INKA and Pertamina.

History
For a long time local companies in Indonesia have tried to design their own cars but failed to manufacture those in mass production. Besides Esemka, few other local made cars got publicity in the past, which include Gea by state-owned train manufacturer PT Industri Kereta Api (Inka), Tawon of PT Super Gasindo Jaya, and Fin Komodo of PT Fin Komodo Technology. A company PT Kiat Mahesa Wintor Indonesia (KMWI) has been commercially manufacturing a rural vehicle named as Mahesa since 2018.
Journey of Esemka involved a number of Indonesian vocational high schools (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan or SMK). Kiat Esemka was the first Esemka car, which was made in 2011 by students of SMK 1 Trucuk, a state-run vocational high school in Klaten, Central Java. The car got wide publicity when Joko Widodo started to use as official vehicle as Mayor of Solo during that time.
