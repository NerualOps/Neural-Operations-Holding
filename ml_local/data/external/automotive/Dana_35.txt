Title: Dana 35

The Dana/Spicer Model 35 is an automotive axle. It has been manufactured by Dana Holding Corporation since 1985 when American Motors (AMC) sold its axle tooling equipment to Dana. The axle was named AMC-15 when it was first made in 1962. Dana upgraded the axle, and added IFS and Twin Traction Beam front axle variations.

Specifications
The Dana 35 (as well as the AMC-15) is used in many vehicles. The most common applications are as a rear axle in the Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Wrangler, and Jeep Comanche and as a front axle in the Ford Explorer and Ford Ranger. It is "reliable in day-to-day street use, but notoriously the opposite when worked hard."
As the AMC-15 it was used in many AMC cars, most commonly with four and six cylinder engines.
