Title: Volkswagen-Audi V8 engine

The Volkswagen-Audi V8 engine family is a series of mechanically similar, gasoline-powered and diesel-powered, V-8, internal combustion piston engines, developed and produced by the Volkswagen Group, in partnership with Audi, since 1988. They have been used in various Volkswagen Group models, and by numerous Volkswagen-owned companies. The first spark-ignition gasoline V-8 engine configuration was used in the 1988 Audi V8 model; and the first compression-ignition diesel V8 engine configuration was used in the 1999 Audi A8 3.3 TDI Quattro. The V8 gasoline and diesel engines have been used in most Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche, Bentley, and Lamborghini models ever since. The larger-displacement diesel V8 engine configuration has also been used in various Scania commercial vehicles; such as in trucks, buses, and marine (boat) applications.

Discontinued production engines
Gasoline
All Volkswagen Group V8 gasoline engines are constructed from a lightweight, cast aluminum alloy cylinder block (crankcase) and cylinder heads.  They all use multi-valve technology, with the valves being operated by two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank (sometimes referred to as 'quad cam').  All functions of engine control are carried out by varying types of Robert Bosch GmbH Motronic electronic engine control units.  They are all longitudinally front-mounted, and the V8 engines listed below were for a long time only used in cars bearing the Audi marque, but latterly being installed in Volkswagen Passenger Cars flagship Volkswagen Phaeton.

4.0 V8 32v TDI CR 202kW
When introduced in May 2003, this 3.9 litre V8 was the highest power and highest torque diesel V8 fitted in any production car worldwide.  This was the second 'new' V engine from Audi which utilises new technologies - including chain-driven overhead camshafts and ancillary units, following the 4.2 40-valve V8 petrol engine first seen in the B6 S4.  This engine was discontinued in July 2005, superseded by the bored-out and updated but fundamentally identical 4.2 V8 TDI.

Current production engines
Gasoline
Of their eight-cylinder petrol engines, all Volkswagen Group V8 engines are primarily constructed from a lightweight cast aluminium alloy cylinder block (crankcase) and cylinder heads. They all use multi-valve technology, with the valves being operated by two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank (sometimes referred to as 'quad cam'). All functions of engine control are carried out by varying types of Robert Bosch GmbH Motronic electronic engine control units.
These V8 petrol engines initially were only used in cars bearing the Audi marque, but are now also installed in Volkswagen Passenger Cars 'premium models'. They are all longitudinally orientated, and with the exception of the Audi R8, are front-mounted.

4.2 V8 FSI 32v
Based on the existing Audi 40 valve V8, this new engine is heavily revised over its predecessor, with all-new components including: crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, cylinder heads, and valvetrain, oil and cooling system, intake and exhaust system, and engine management system. It is available in two versions; a basic or 'comfort' version, first used in the Audi Q7; and a sports-focussed high-revving version, with features borrowed from motorsport, for the B7 RS 4 quattro and the R8. This is the first eight-cylinder road car engine to use Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), which was successfully developed by Audi in their Le Mans-winning R8 racing car. The 5.2 V10 FSI was developed directly from this V8 engine.

4.0 TFSI
This engine is part of Audi's modular 90° V6/V8 engine family. It shares its bore and stroke, 90° V-angle, and 90mm cylinder spacing with the Audi V6. The earlier V6 engines (EA837) used an Eaton TVS Supercharger instead of turbocharger(s). In 2016, Audi and Porsche released a new turbocharged V6 engine they dubbed EA839. These 2.9L (biturbo) & 3.0L (single turbo) V6 engines share the 4.0T TFSI V8's “hot vee” design, meaning the turbo(s) are placed in the Vee of the engine (between each bank of cylinders) instead of on the outside of each cylinder bank. This allows the turbocharger(s) to produce boost pressure more quickly as the path the exhaust gases travel is much reduced. It also aids in getting the engine's emissions hardware up to temperature more quickly. As with the V6, the V8 is used in various Audi and Porsche models, but the V8 also finds use in Bentley and Lamborghini vehicles.

Production
The engine was developed in Ingolstadt.

Racing engine
The race version of the  engine was developed and produced for the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, between 1990 and 1992; and later the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and in the Audi R8C, Audi R8R, Audi R8 and Bentley Speed 8, between 1999 and 2018.

Audi V8
Audi developed a Group A competition version of the Audi V8 engine for entry into the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) (German Touring Car Championship) auto racing series equipped with a 309 kW (420 PS; 414 bhp), later 340 kW (462 PS; 456 bhp), 3.6 V8 engine and 6-speed manual transmission, and began racing with it in 1990 with Schmidt MotorSport (SMS) running the operation, and Hans-Joachim Stuck, Walter Röhrl and Frank Jelinski driving.

Audi R8C/R8R engine
The R8C and R8R both use 3.6-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 engines, producing between 600–640 hp (447–477 kW), and between 516–561 lb⋅ft (700–761 N⋅m) of torque, while using two 32.4 mm (1.28 in) air restrictors, and pushing 1.67 bar (24.2 psi) of absolute boost pressure. While the R8R has a large number of vents placed on the nose, most of the intakes and air exits on the R8C are placed on the sides.
The R8R was estimated to boast around 610 hp (450 kW) from its V8 engine, allowing it to hit 335 km/h (208 mph) in 1999 at Le Mans (the original claims were that the car could go 350 km/h (217 mph)).

Audi R8 engine
The R8 is powered by a 3.6 L Audi V8 with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), which is a variation on the concept of gasoline direct injection developed by VW; it maximizes both power and fuel economy at the same time. FSI technology can be found in products available to the public, across all brands in the Volkswagen Group.
The power supplied by the R8, officially listed at about 610 hp (455 kW) in 2000, 2001, and 2002, 550 hp (410.1 kW) in 2003 and 2004, and 520 hp (388 kW) in 2005, is sent to the rear wheels via a Ricardo six-speed sequential transmission with an electropneumatic paddle shift. Unofficially, the works team Audi R8 for Le Mans (2000, 2001, and 2002) is said to have had around 670 hp (500 kW) instead of the quoted 610 hp. The numbers were quoted at speed, and were due to the car making 50 extra horsepower due to twin ram-air intakes at speeds over 150 mph (240 km/h). Official torque numbers were quoted for this version of the engine at 516 lb⋅ft (700 N⋅m) at 6500 rpm (2004/2005), but the 2002/2003-spec engine produced more torque; with 553 lb⋅ft (750 N⋅m) at 5500 rpm, with boost pressure set at 1.67 bar (24.2 psi) absolute. The equation for horsepower (torque divided by 5250, multiplied by rpm) for these numbers produces a horsepower rating of 638 horsepower (476 kW) at the same 6500 rpm (516/5250*6500=638).
Restrictor changes for 2003 brought the power down to 550 bhp for anyone still racing with the R8, but the maximum torque hardly changed.
For 2005, The ACO still felt that the R8 needed to be kept in check, so they reduced the restrictor size on the R8's engine, due to the car not meeting new hybrid regulations, and stipulated the car shall carry ballast weight in an attempt to make the races more competitive. The R8 was restricted even further to only 520 bhp.

Bentley Speed 8/EXP Speed 8 engine
The engine from the Audi R8, a 3.6-liter V8, with (Honeywell Turbo Technologies) turbocharger, was used as the initial powerplant for the Bentley in 2001. It produced 637 hp (475 kW) and over 479 lb⋅ft (649 N⋅m) of torque, via two 33.1 mm (1.30 in) intake restrictor, with boost pressure limited to 1.87 bar (27.1 psi) by regulations.
Following its initial year of competition, the Audi-sourced V8 was modified to better suit the EXP Speed 8. This saw the engine expand to 4.0 liters, producing between 600–650 hp (450–480 kW), and 590 lb⋅ft (800 N⋅m) of torque, using two 30.7 mm (1.21 in) intake restrictor plates, with boost pressure still being limited to 1.87 bar (27.1 psi) by regulations. This would ultimately lead to Bentley redesigning the car for 2003, leading to the change of name to simply Speed. Without the intake restrictor plates (completely unrestricted), and with boost pressure set at around 1.9 bar (28 psi), the 4.0-liter engine is reportedly capable of producing up to 860 hp (640 kW), and about 750 lb⋅ft (1,020 N⋅m) of torque.

Audi DTM V8 engine
The Audi DTM V8 engine family is a series of prototype, four-stroke, 3.6-liter to 4.0-liter, naturally aspirated V-8 racing engines, developed and produced by Audi for the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft, between 1990 and 1992; and later the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, between 2000 and 2018.

Audi V8 DTM
Audi developed a Group A competition version of the Audi V8 engine for entry into the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) (German Touring Car Championship) auto racing series equipped with a 309 kW (420 PS; 414 bhp), later 340 kW (462 PS; 456 bhp), 3.6 V8 engine and 6-speed manual transmission, and began racing with it in 1990 with Schmidt MotorSport (SMS) running the operation, and Hans-Joachim Stuck, Walter Röhrl and Frank Jelinski driving.

Audi TT-R DTM
The Audi TT-R DTM uses a 4.0 L (244 cu in) Audi naturally-aspirated V8 engine in partnership with Neil Brown Engineering for development, building, assembly, maintenance and tune-up role, it has a power output of approximately 455 hp (339 kW; 461 PS) at 6,800 rpm and a maximum torque of about 510 N⋅m (376 lbf⋅ft) at 6,000 rpm, while using two 28 mm (1.1 in) air intake restrictors.

Audi A4 DTM
The Audi A4 DTM is powered by a 4.0 L (244 cu in) Audi naturally-aspirated V8 engine in partnership with Neil Brown Engineering for development, building, assembly, maintenance and tune-up role, it has a power output of approximately 460 hp (343 kW; 466 PS) and a maximum torque of more than 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft).

Audi A5/RS5 DTM
The A5 DTM was still fitted with a V8 engine that used in a previous Audi A4 DTM and Abt-Audi TT DTM were built jointly by Audi and Neil Brown Engineering (NBE) rated at 460 hp (343 kW) and coupled to a 6-speed transmission grafted from the previous A4 DTM car, while using a Bosch MS 5.1 ECU.
After the 2012 season, the vehicle was renamed RS5 DTM, corresponding with the Audi RS5 production model. It is powered by a naturally-aspirated engine and 2x DOHC camshafts. The engine itself is a custom-built Audi 4.0 L V8, with four valves per cylinder, and a 90-degree V-angle. It now has a power output of over 500 hp (373 kW; 507 PS) and torque of over 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft). Front engined and longitudinally mounted engine mounting layout, the RS5's engine is indirect fuel injected. The RS5 DTM's ECU is a Bosch Motronic MS 5.1 and other components such as the CDI ignition are also supplied by Bosch.
